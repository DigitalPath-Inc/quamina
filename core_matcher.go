// coreMatcher represents an automaton that allows matching sequences of
// name/value field pairs against
//  patterns, which are combinations of field names and lists of allowed valued field values.
// The field names are called "Paths" because they encode, in a jsonpath-ish
// style, the pathSegments from the
//  root of an incoming object to the leaf field.
// Since the order of fields is generally not significant in encoded data
// objects, the fields are sorted
//  by name before constructing the automaton, and so are the incoming field lists to be matched, allowing
//  the automaton to work.

// coreMatcher uses an automaton to implement addPattern and matchesForFields.
// There are two levels of concurrency here. First, the lock field in this struct must be held by any goroutine
// that is executing addPattern(), i.e. only one thread may be updating the state machine at one time.
// However, any number of goroutines may in parallel be executing matchesForFields while the addPattern
// update is in progress. The updateable atomic.Value allows the addPattern thread to change the maps and
// slices in the structure atomically with atomic.Load() while matchesForFields threads are reading them.

	updateable atomic.Value // always holds a *coreFields
	lock       sync.Mutex

// coreFields groups the updateable fields in coreMatcher.
// state is the start of the automaton.
// namesUsed is a map of field names that are used in any of the patterns that this automaton encodes. Typically,
// patterns only consider a subset of the fields in an incoming data object, and there is no reason to consider
// fields that do not appear in patterns when using the automaton for matching.
// fakeField is used when the flattener for an event returns no fields, because it could still match if
// there were patterns with "exists":false. So in this case we run one fake field through the matcher
// which will cause it to notice that any "exists":false patterns should match.
